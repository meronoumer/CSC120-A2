Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment. 

What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

Some  helpful strategies I found when doing this assignment were to run my code periodically to catch bugs early .It was also very helpful to have my notes next to me while working on this assignment and to go back and make sure I had a thorough understanding of the exercise from the lecture before. 

One thing that didn't work was staring at a difficult problem for too long, instead of taking a brain break and coming back to it. 

Whenever you're stuck , go back to the instructions, they're very detailed and extremely helpful and the answer to whichever issue you're facing is usually there. I also recommend getting started on this assignment early , so that you have the time to take breaks between tough spots.
